  <h1>Swing Dancing!</h1>

  <p>Swing dancing is my favorite hobby!</p>

  <h2>Styles of Swing Dance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>[Lindy Hop](lindyhop.html) (My favorite type)</li>
      <li>[Charleston](charleston.html) (A great way to take a break from faster dances or a wonderful dance on its own!)</li>
      <li>[East Coast Swing](east_coast.html) (The easy to learn variant of Swing)</li>
      <li>[Balboa](balboa.html) (Great for fast music and close connection!)</li>
      <li>[West Coast Swing](west_coast.html) (To be honest, I have gripes about whether this is actually swing, but it's still a good dance)</li>
    </ul>
