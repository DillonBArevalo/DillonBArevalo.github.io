  I think this is a pretty good place to learn about Swing Dance. It has a lot of information on it with links to more and, as far as I can tell with a quick skim, looks pretty accurate! I think it should have more information on social dancing as I think of that as the main draw and biggest part of swing dancing (not just in a personal sense, but when looking at the Swing Dance culture as a whole). I also think that videos should be more prominently linked for it to be as engaging and educational as possible.
