  <h1>Welcome to my page on the Lindy Hop!</h1>
  <p>
    The Lindy Hop is an 8 count dance (meaning each individual move usually takes 8 beats of the music to complete). It is exemplified by a strong bounce, step-step-triple step style footwork, and its distinctive circular movement style.

    Here's a picture of me performing the Lindy Hop!
